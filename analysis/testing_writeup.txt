dp-frontend-router crash
------------------------

( during week ending Friday 24th April 2020 )


Some tests, observations, possibly oversimplified analysis, suggestions:
========================================================================

Tests carried out on:
** Ubuntu 18.04LTS, 6core/12thread, SSD, 64GB RAM
** go version go1.14 linux/amd64

Test set up:

(NOTE: no other services - like Zebedee ure running, which will no doubt contribute to observations seen)

1. Adjust dp-front-end-router/main.go to have it run in Visual Studio Code under debug:

var (
	// BuildTime represents the time in which the service was built
	BuildTime string = "1587727818"
	// GitCommit represents the commit (SHA-1) hash of the service that is running
	GitCommit string = "6584b786caac36b6214ffe04bf62f058d4021538"
	// Version represents the version of the service that is running
	Version string = "v1.14.0"
)

2. Run it in Debug mode

3. In another terminal, run autocannon.go with line:

	go run autocannon.go --pipelining=12 --uri=http://localhost:20000/embed/visualisations/

	==> autocannon-go came from: https://github.com/GlenTiki/autocannon-go

Test 1:
=======

Do the "Test set up" as above.

Observation:
dp-frontend-router gets hit with ~6500 Req/sec and Memory use does not grow.

Test 2:
=======

Do the "Test set up" as above - AND

Step # 4:

4. whilst step 3 is running, in its terminal press cursor up and press Enter to line up the next HTTP load test.

Do step 4 rapidly 30 times to line up a long stream of HTTP requests.

Observation:
dp-frontend-router gets hit with ~6500 Req/sec and Memory use grows by 6 G Bytes as visual studio code caches
all of the log() outputs, as it attempts to output them in its DEBUG CONSOLE.
Once the 'autocannon' HTTP Load tests have finished, it takes a LONG time for visual studio code to finish
print / scrolling the Log() outputs from dp-frontend-router to its DEBUG CONSOLE ... and as it does this, the
memory used is free'd.
Thus NO memory Leaks.

Test 3:
=======

Repeat Test 2, BUT do not run dp-frontend-router with visual studio code in debug mode, instead run it from a new
terminal as follows:

	go run main.go > /dev/null 2>&1

Also, when it is running, open a 2nd terminal for autocannon and repeat step 4 from Test 3 for two instances of
autocannon in their respective terminals.

Observation:
dp-frontend-router gets hit with ~11,500 Req/sec between both instances of autocannon and Memory use does NOT grow.
CPU usage went up to about 75% on all cores.

Test 4:
=======

First edit the log.go file that dp-frontend-router has been built against on your machine, [mine is
 at: ~/gobook/pkg/mod/github/!o!n!sdigital/log.go@v1.0.0/log/log.go]
and comment out on line, at ~line 70 as such:

func Event(ctx context.Context, event string, opts ...option) {
	//!!!	eventFuncInst.f(ctx, event, opts...)
}

this stops the very expensive CPU processing and output to terminal window that is also expensive of CPU cycles to
render and scroll.

Then, Repeat Test 3

Observation:
dp-frontend-router gets hit with ~68,000+ Req/sec between both instances of autocannon and Memory use does NOT grow.
CPU usage went up to about 82% on all cores.

Test 5:
=======

First build main.go for dp-frontend-router, and build autocannon.go

then run the files as:

./main in one terminal

and run two instances of autocannon in seperate terminals, as:

./autocannon --pipelining=12 --uri=http://localhost:20000/embed/visualisations/

and do as step 4 of Test 2 for both instances of autocannon

Observation:
dp-frontend-router gets hit with ~70,800 Req/sec between both instances of autocannon and Memory use does NOT grow.
CPU usage went up to about 82% on all cores.


Analysis:
=========

From the observed behaviour in the above tests, one might surmise the following:

When dp-frontend-router is running in its container on AWS, its log() output is being captured by some AWS utility
and sent off to AWS log stash.
I suspect this AWS utility is doing some sort of bandwidth limiting and in so doing building up its own cache of
the Log() output from dp-frontend-router before sending to AWS log stash ... and thus memory use grows to the
point of Docker container failure.

However if all of the other services like Zebedee were running and being talked to by dp-frontend-router there may
be much different observations.

Conclusion:
===========

1. The jump in the amount of Requests/sec from Test 3 to Test 4 is significant and demonstrates Logging is taking
a sizeable amount of CPU time ... a jump from ~11,500 to ~68,000+ Requests is quite something.

2. The tests above would indicate that dp-frontend-router is NOT leaking memory, per se.

However, to be more confident of that one would need to have the full suite of Apps running and talking to one
another and then perform a 'pprof' run of dp-frontend-router with pprof set up to analyse memory usage over a
period of ~60 seconds, etc and exercise it with two instances of autocannon again.

3. One possibility (just speculation) could be that if all other services were running during the tests detailed here ...
 As each socket connection is made and the request trickles out from dp-frontend-router to the other Applications ...
  It takes a while for each request to complete such that more and more socket connections are opened ...
   *** Due to the "Unbounded Parallelism" of dp-frontend-router code (hmmm) ... ***
    And remain open ...
     Each socket connection is handled with a "file descriptor" ...
      The "file descriptor limit" is reached ...
       The App stops with a fatal error (or something similar) ...
        The App has PID number 1 ...
         When PID 1 stops the container STOPs

          ... and the Container management system restarts the Container ...

NOTE: See SECTION 8.6 - Concurrent Web Crawler (in The GO Programming Language 2016 edition)
      ... AND in PARTICULAR Page 241, 2nd paragraph ... starting with the sentence "The program is TOO parallel." ...


Suggestions:
============

  (I'm sure some of these have been considered, but for completness ...)

1. Increase the memory available to the environment the dp-frontend-router container is running on.

2. Consider using "github.com/rs/zerolog/log" to reduce log traffic and much better performance.
   It's approach takes Uber's zap library to the next level. See its README.md at "https://github.com/rs/zerolog"
   The part of the README.md that paints a significant picture is the 'Benchmarks' - *** - a must read.
   This then has a link to Ubers zap library and its section on Performance "https://github.com/uber-go/zap#performance",
   Where it states the following:
=====
For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and string formatting are prohibitively
expensive — they're CPU-intensive and make many small allocations. Put differently, using encoding/json and
fmt.Fprintf to log tons of interface{}s makes your application slow.
=====
   And, ... on inspecting the ONS's https://github.com/ONSdigital/log.go/blob/master/log/log.go ... it would appear
to be doing a number of CPU-intensive things.
   And dp-frontend-router DOES log in the hot path.

***	See APPENDIX 3 for an example of timing how long the log.Event() takes in createReverseProxy()
 ... which is on the HOT PATH ...

3. In dp-frontend-router, Add another Middleware layer before all other layers that does "HTTP requests rate limiting",
by crafting ones own, such as:
	https://pauladamsmith.com/blog/2016/04/max-clients-go-net-http.html
   OR a library, such as:
	https://github.com/ulule/limiter

4. Run up an instance of the whole ONS website on a different 'test' domain name that is not advertised.
   Adjust the performance logging tools that are gathering stats for memory usage, CPU usage and network usage for
    the dp-frontend-router such that these particular statistics are being logged every 50ms - and also configured
    to send this log data every 50ms (that is don't cache and write one a minute, or whatever).
   Then hammer this new website from say 5 different computers at ONS at the same time with them using autocannon
    (or something similar) in the manner described in step 4 above.
   This last step, you ay want to build it up with regards the number of Load testing apps running at a time, just
    start with 1 to start with and build up ...
   Also for this test, have Cloudfare disabled.
   With any luck this 'test' site will crash and you will have performance log files to analyse and gain a fuller
    understanding of the real-time dynamic under load.

5. Increase the RAM and CPU cores used to deploy dp-frontend-router:
	RAM	  : increase by x4 to x8
	CPU cores : increase by x4 to x8

6. So ... How what is the "file descriptor limit" for the dp-frontend-router Application Container ???
   Implement some sort of test that stresses the current limit, increase if need be and retest, loop this until happy.

APPENDIX 1:
===========

For each HTTP request made with autocannon, the following is being logged (~742 bytes):

{
  "created_at": "2020-04-25T19:19:57.26100652Z",
  "event": "http request received",
  "http": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/embed/visualisations/",
    "started_at": "2020-04-25T19:19:57.261005003Z",
    "status_code": 0
  },
  "namespace": "dp-frontend-router",
  "trace_id": "UXJcGYhgUQmtPqXT"
}
{
  "created_at": "2020-04-25T19:19:57.261833223Z",
  "event": "http request completed",
  "http": {
    "duration": 3423764,
    "ended_at": "2020-04-25T19:19:57.261829164Z",
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/embed/visualisations/",
    "query": "%3Auri=embed%2Fvisualisations%2F",
    "started_at": "2020-04-25T19:19:57.2584054Z",
    "status_code": 502
  },
  "namespace": "dp-frontend-router",
  "trace_id": "JlKnSSAQxcVCzZhr"
}

At say 8,000 requests per second, thats 742*8000 = 5,936,000 bytes / second [plus any other stuff] dumping to AWS
 log stash ... hmmm.

-=-=-

There are other frequent entries in the log due to not having any other services running ... which may be making
 these particular tests much worse.
BUT these other entries ONLY occure when dp-frontend-router is receiving the HTTP requests.

There are also the regular healthcheck log outputs at 30 second intervals, etc.


APPENDIX 2:
===========

The output from autocannon for Test 5, typically looks like:

running 10s test @ http://localhost:20000/embed/visualisations/
10 connections with 12 pipelining factor.

Done!


APPENDIX 3:
===========

The measured timings that follow were as a result of making the following code adjustments, and following steps 1 to 3:

1. In main.go of dp-frontend-router, change the chunk of code for createReverseProxy() to:
-----

var (
	tMutex sync.Mutex

	total_time     int64
	total_requests int64
	average_time   int64
)

func createReverseProxy(proxyName string, proxyURL *url.URL) http.Handler {
	proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(proxyURL)
	director := proxy.Director
	proxy.Transport = &http.Transport{
		Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
		DialContext: (&net.Dialer{
			Timeout:   5 * time.Second,
			KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
		}).DialContext,
		MaxIdleConns:          100,
		IdleConnTimeout:       90 * time.Second,
		TLSHandshakeTimeout:   5 * time.Second,
		ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
	}
	proxy.Director = func(req *http.Request) {
		{
			start := time.Now()
			log.Event(req.Context(), "proxying request", log.INFO, log.HTTP(req, 0, 0, nil, nil), log.Data{
				"destination": proxyURL,
				"proxy_name":  proxyName,
			})
			duration := time.Since(start)
			fmt.Printf("took : %s\n", duration)
			tMutex.Lock()
			total_requests++
			total_time += duration.Nanoseconds()
			//total_time += duration.Microseconds()
			average_time = total_time / total_requests
			tMutex.Unlock()
			fmt.Printf("average : %v\n", average_time)
		}
		director(req)
	}
	return proxy
}

2. Build main.go and run as such:
-----
	go build main.go
	
	./main >l.txt 2>&1

3. In another terminal in the autocannon folder, fire of a stress test of HTTP requests with:
-----
	./autocannon --pipelining=12 --uri=http://localhost:20000/embed/visualisations/

Once autocannon has finished, wait 10 seconds and then do CTRL-C in the terminal for the dp-frontend-router's main.go

4. The autocannon report will look similar to:
-----

10 connections with 12 pipelining factor.

0 2xx responses, 66781 non 2xx responses.
67k total requests in 10 seconds, 9.8 MB read.
Done!

5. The log.Error() output from the function that is being timed looks like:
-----

{
  "created_at": "2020-04-26T15:19:23.282702353Z",
  "data": {
    "destination": {
      "ForceQuery": false,
      "Fragment": "",
      "Host": "localhost:8080",
      "Opaque": "",
      "Path": "",
      "RawPath": "",
      "RawQuery": "",
      "Scheme": "http",
      "User": null
    },
    "proxy_name": "babbage"
  },
  "event": "proxying request",
  "http": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/embed/visualisations/",
    "query": "%3Auri=embed%2Fvisualisations%2F",
    "status_code": 0
  },
  "namespace": "dp-frontend-router",
  "severity": 3,
  "trace_id": "rEimNRKhbLUJLGqX"
}
took : 76.993µs
average : 197844

-=-=-

*** The average above is in Nanoseconds, so that's 197 Microseconds  - JUST for the above output to a file on a
 FAST SSD (via RAM buffering).

The size of l.txt is : 121.9 Mega Bytes

The average Requests per second for this test was 6678

So, multiplying 197 by 6678 we get 1.315566 seconds  ... BUT thats running on 12 cores, so divide by 12 to
 get 0.10963 seconds

That's ~11% of time in just that one log.Event() that is on the HOT PATH during heavy load request.

And NOTE: There are a number of other log.Event()'s that are on the HOT PATH for EVERY request.

-=-=-

197 Microseconds average to do a ONS log.Event() does not compare well to other libraries:

[ the following copied from https://github.com/rs/zerolog on 26th April 2020 ]

Log a message and 10 fields:
Library 	Time 		Bytes Allocated 	Objects Allocated
zerolog 	767 ns/op 	552 B/op 		6 allocs/op
  ...
log15 		20657 ns/op 	5632 B/op 		93 allocs/op


Log a message with a logger that already has 10 fields of context:
Library 	Time 		Bytes Allocated 	Objects Allocated
zerolog 	52 ns/op 	0 B/op 			0 allocs/op
  ...
log15 		14179 ns/op 	2642 B/op 		44 allocs/op


Log a static string, without any context or printf-style templating:
Library 	Time 		Bytes Allocated 	Objects Allocated
zerolog 	50 ns/op 	0 B/op 			0 allocs/op
  ...
log15 		5181 ns/op 	1592 B/op 		26 allocs/op


In this Appendix's test *** :

	1. At best, the ONS log.Event() is 9 times slower than the slowest alternative - log15

	2. At worst, the ONS log.Event() is 256 times slower than the fastest alternative - zerolog


[ that is if i have not made any mistake(s) in gathering the data presented ]

Please note the above comparison number(s) should be taken "for indication and painting a picture ONLY",
                                                           ============================================  
 because i do not know the performance of the machine used when generating the performance timing for zerolog
 and the others
 AND
 The test covered in this appendix will not be a direct comparison to the ones done on the other libraries,

    BUT  probably close enough.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Obviously having Cloudflare running is the best thing to do.


Hope this investigation / analysis helps,
