An easy and CHEAP optimisation:

In reading up on zerolog, one of the things i've noticed being done is to shorten the event descriptor ...

and in the case of ONS ...

one could do:

--------------
"created_at":"2020-04-27T15:50:32.729286447Z",

becomes:
"t": <numeric number in format as user in zerolog> ... expressed as ASCII characters ... which is much shorter
 than ONS current time format

==> i believe, in zerolog, one sets its time format, for example: zerolog.TimeFieldFormat = time.RFC3339Nano
   OR zerolog.TimeFieldFormat = TimeFormatUnixMicro

--------------
"namespace":"dp-frontend-router",

becomes:
"n":"dp-frontend-router",

--------------
"event":"third party logs",

becomes
"ev":"third party logs",

--------------
"data":{"raw":"http: proxy error: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused"}}

becomes

"d":{"raw":"http: proxy error: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused"}}

--------------
"trace_id":"UKAvvPVnhQcJcYEO",

becomes:
"id":"UKAvvPVnhQcJcYEO",


That's 29 characters saved PLUS ~11 in the time format, saving ~40 bytes for almost every event log

And the log file i'm looking at has 352732 log lines * 40 bytes = 14,109,280 bytes

 saved out of 102,958,793 bytes in logfile gives a reduction of 13.7%

-=-=-

That would translate into financial savings on the amount of data logged and be a simple thing to implement and
a simple thing to improve the performance of the web site a little.
